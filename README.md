Okay, I will explain how Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and interaction terms work, both intuitively and mathematically, based on the provided document.

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

### Intuitive Explanation

Imagine you're trying to predict something, but a standard linear regression doesn't quite fit because the thing you're predicting:

*   Isn't normally distributed (e.g., it's always positive, it's a count, or it's a category).
*   Has a relationship with your features that isn't a straight line.

A GLM is a flexible tool that extends linear regression to handle these situations. It does this by:

1.  **Using a different distribution:** Instead of assuming your outcome is normally distributed, you pick a distribution that makes more sense for your data (e.g., Poisson for counts, Bernoulli for probabilities).
2.  **Using a link function:** This function connects the weighted sum of your features to the *expected value* of your chosen distribution.  It allows for a non-linear relationship between the features and the outcome.

**Analogy:**

Think of linear regression as trying to fit a straight line through data, assuming the data points are scattered normally around that line. A GLM is like having different shaped curves (based on your chosen distribution) and a flexible connector (the link function) to fit the data more accurately.

**Example:**

Predicting the number of coffees you drink in a day.  A linear model might predict negative coffees (which is nonsensical). A GLM with a Poisson distribution (since coffee counts are non-negative integers) and a log link function would be more appropriate.

### Mathematical Explanation

A GLM consists of three parts:

1.  **Random Component:** A probability distribution from the exponential family (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial) that describes the distribution of the outcome variable $$Y$$.
2.  **Systematic Component (Linear Predictor):** A linear combination of the predictors:
    $$
    \eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_p x_p = \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol{\beta}
    $$
    where:
    *   $$\mathbf{x}$$ is the vector of features.
    *   $$\boldsymbol{\beta}$$ is the vector of coefficients.
3.  **Link Function:** A function $$g$$ that relates the expected value of the response variable $$\mathbb{E}[Y|\mathbf{x}]$$ to the linear predictor $$\eta$$:
    $$
    g(\mathbb{E}[Y|\mathbf{x}]) = \eta = \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol{\beta}
    $$

**Common Link Functions:**

*   **Identity Link:** $$g(u) = u$$ (used in standard linear regression with a Gaussian distribution).
*   **Log Link:** $$g(u) = \ln(u)$$ (often used with Poisson distribution for count data).
*   **Logit Link:** $$g(u) = \ln(\frac{u}{1-u})$$ (used with Bernoulli distribution for logistic regression).

**Example: Poisson GLM**

If $$Y$$ is a count variable, we might use a Poisson distribution and a log link:

$$
\ln(\mathbb{E}[Y|\mathbf{x}]) = \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol{\beta}
$$

This means:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y|\mathbf{x}] = \exp(\mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol{\beta})
$$

The expected count is the exponential of the linear combination of the features.

## Interaction Terms

### Intuitive Explanation

Sometimes, the effect of one feature on the outcome depends on the value of another feature. This is an *interaction*.

**Example:**

The effect of temperature on bike rentals might be different on workdays versus weekends. On weekends, people might be more likely to rent bikes when it's warm. On workdays, temperature might not matter as much because people are renting bikes for commuting.

### Mathematical Explanation

To include interactions in a linear model (or GLM), you create a new feature that is the *product* of the interacting features.

**Example: Interaction between a numerical and a categorical feature**

Suppose you have a numerical feature "temperature" ($$temp$$) and a categorical feature "workday" (work, with values Y/N). To model the interaction, you create a new feature:

$$
\text{workY.temp} = \begin{cases}
temp & \text{if work = Y} \\
0 & \text{if work = N}
\end{cases}
$$

Then, your linear model becomes:

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{workY} + \beta_2 \cdot temp + \beta_3 \cdot \text{workY.temp}
$$

*   $$\beta_1$$ represents the effect of workday when temperature is 0.
*   $$\beta_2$$ represents the effect of temperature on non-workdays.
*   $$\beta_3$$ represents the *additional* effect of temperature on workdays, compared to non-workdays.

By including the interaction term, the model can learn different slopes for the "temperature" feature depending on whether it's a workday or not.
